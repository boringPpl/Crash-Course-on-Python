# Roadmap: Basic Python for automation

> There are different approaches to learning, we categorize them into bottom up and top down approaches
> 
> If you are a top down learner, we suggest you to look through the projects and see what it takes to build it, then learn through the syllabus and try to implement the concept to your problem on the go
> 
> If you are a bottom up learner, you might just go ahead to learn the syllabus and explore the projects later once you feel confidence with your foundation.
> 
> Either way, we highly recommend you to go through each concepts at least 3-5 times with different explanation, exercises to profoundly understand it.

# Knowledge checkpoints

- [ ] [**Milestone 0: Set up the environment**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU&index=1) (You can skip this and come back later if the syllabus you are taking provies the coding editor)
    - [ ] Install Python 3
    - [ ] Install the IDE (eg. Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, etc) 
    - [ ] Execute and run code with terminal commands (eg. cd, ls, python3, etc)

- [ ] **Milestone 1: Learning Basic Python syntax**

    - [ ] get to know different data types (eg. `str()`, `int()`, `list()`)
    - [ ] variables and naming convention
    - [ ] comment # 
    - [ ] `print()` 
        - [ ] one variables
        - [ ] multiple variables using `format()`
    - [ ] read the input data from users using `input()`
        - [ ] restrict the data type using `str()`, `int()`, `list()` ...

- [ ] **Milestone 2: Working with numeric data - integer and float**
    - [ ] Arithmetic Operators (output: result)
    - [ ] Comparison (output: True/ False)
    - [ ] Shortcut. Eg. `num += 1` 
    - [ ] Commonly used methods: absolute `abs()`, `round()`, etc
    - [ ] Work with numbers in string format. Eg. "3"
    - [ ] Advanced math `import math`
- [ ] **Milestone 3: Working with textual data - string**
    - [ ] Single quotes vs. Double quotes
    - [ ] Create multi-line string using triple quotes `'''` or `\n`
    - [ ] Commonly used functions and methods in string
        - [ ] Check data types: `type()`
        - [ ] Check string length: `len()`
        - [ ] Index
        - [ ] `lower()` or `upper()` 
        - [ ] Concatination 
        - [ ] `replace()`

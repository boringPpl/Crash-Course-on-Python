# Roadmap: Python Programming from Foundation to Application (6 months)

> There are different approaches to learning, we categorize them into bottom up and top down approaches
> 
> If you are a top down learner, we suggest you to look through the projects and see what it takes to build it, then learn through the syllabus and try to implement the concept to your problem on the go
> 
> If you are a bottom up learner, you might just go ahead to learn the syllabus and explore the projects later once you feel confidence with your foundation.
> 
> Either way, we highly recommend you to go through each concepts at least 3-5 times with different explanation, exercises to profoundly understand it.

'''

# 1) Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6  # approximately 1.6 km in 1 mile

my_trip_miles = 60

# 2) Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
my_trip_km = ___

# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
print("The distance in kilometers is " + ___)

# 4) Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result,
#    and fill in the blank to print the result

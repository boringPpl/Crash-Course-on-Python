''' Question 3.3:
Write a cal_lucky_number function. Your lucky number is equal to the length of your name times 8.
The function receives a name as parameter. And return a message. 
Fill in the blanks to complete the code to make it work.


Note: Instead of printing the message, we will return the message. 
This way, the calling line can print the message, 
or do something else with it if needed.

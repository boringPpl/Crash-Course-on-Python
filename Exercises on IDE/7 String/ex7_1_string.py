'''Question 7.1:
The highlight function changes the given word in a statement 
to its upper-case version. 

For example, highlight("Have a nice day", "day") 
returns "Have a nice DAY". 

Can you write this function in just one line?
'''

def highlight(statement, word):
	return(___)

print(highlight("Have a nice day", "nice"))
print(highlight("Shhh, don't be so loud!", "loud"))
print(highlight("Automating with Python is fun", "fun"))

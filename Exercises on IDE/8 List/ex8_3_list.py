'''Question 8.3:
Given a list of file_names, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. 
To do this, we would like to generate a new list called new_file_names, consisting of the new file_names. 

Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, 
like a for loop or a list comprehension.
'''

file_names = ["program.py", "stdio.c", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate new_file_names as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.
___  

print(new_file_names) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
